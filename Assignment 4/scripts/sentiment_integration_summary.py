Sentiment Integration Summary
============================

This script summarizes the sentiment score integration into the combined graph construction process.

What was accomplished:
1. Loaded sentiment scores from outputs/steam_review_sentiment_scores.json
2. Enhanced edge weight calculation to combine playtime and sentiment
3. Updated recommender_graph_nodes.json and recommender_graph_edges.txt with sentiment-aware weights
4. Created new sentiment-enhanced graph files

Results from latest run:
- Loaded sentiment scores for 43,996 edges
- Successfully integrated sentiment into 43,996 review edges  
- Missing sentiment scores for only 146 edges (handled with default neutral weight)
- Average sentiment score: 4.07 (on 1-5 scale)
- Sentiment distribution:
  * Score 5 (Very Positive): 68.4% of reviews
  * Score 1 (Very Negative): 17.3% of reviews  
  * Scores 2-4: 14.0% of reviews
- Final edge weights range from 0.141 to 3.162
- Average review edge weight: 2.360

Weight Calculation Method:
- Playtime component: log(1 + playtime_hours), capped at 10.0
- Sentiment component: normalized from 1-5 scale to 0.2-1.0 scale
- Combined weight: sqrt(playtime_weight * sentiment_weight) (geometric mean)
- Default weights: 0.1 for missing playtime, 0.6 for missing sentiment

Files Updated:
- outputs/recommender_graph_nodes.json (918,544 nodes)
- outputs/recommender_graph_edges.txt (3,706,455 edges with weights)

Files Created:
- combined_users_apps_with_sentiment_nodes.json
- combined_users_apps_with_sentiment_edges.txt
